Download the following files for running pySCENIC

1) lists of transcription factors (TFs) for Mouse:
https://resources.aertslab.org/cistarget/tf_lists/allTFs_mm.txt

2) Ranking databases
rankings: Matrix containing motifs as rows and genes as columns and ranking position for each gene and motif (based on CRM scores) as values. To be used with cisTarget (R).
The search space around the TSS of the gene in which the motif is scored is indicated in the database name:
500bpUp: 500bp upstream of TSS.
TSS+/-10kb: 10kb around the TSS (total: 20kb).
TSS+/-5kb: 5kb around the TSS (total: 10kb).
5kbUp,FullTx: 5kb upstream TSS and transcript introns.
500bpUp100Dw: 500bp upstream of TSS, and 100bp downstream.
